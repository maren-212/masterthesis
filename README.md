# masterthesis
As part of the master thesis "Hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models", an NLI-based evaluation framework was developed, which analyses the influence factors of benchmark and model selection as well as hyperparameters in order to subsequently propose a final model for the evaluation of RAG models. 

. The framework was technically realised in the Python programming language and im-plemented in Google Colab using the Colab Pro+ subscription in order to meet the re-quirements of the deep learning algorithms. In this case, 62.8 GB of system RAM is available for calculating the models. If the ML algorithm in question offers a correspond-ing API, the training was carried out on an NVIDIA L4 GPU with 22.5 GB GPU RAM us-ing CUDA 12.2. The follorwing illustration visualises the methodological framework of this thesis.
